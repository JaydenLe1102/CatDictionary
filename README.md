## Overview
### Description
Allows users to learn more about different breeds of cat through text, images, and a video. 

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Dictionary
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices.
- **Story:** Allows users to search for information about different breeds of cat. The user can decide to view only text or images or video. The user can download images. The user can share the page about a breed of cat to social medias including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram.
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how passionate they are about cats.
- **Scope:** First we would start with making a dictionary about breeds of cat. Then, perhaps this could evolve into a dictionary application about many different types of pet as well to broaden its usage.
